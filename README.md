# TestDrivenDevelopmentWithGolang
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

# Introduction
I'm learning GO. After reading the first 5 chapters of Donovan & Kernighan's excellent and highly recommended The Go Programming Language I decided to switch tack to a more hand's approach with the objective to learn GO's test capabilities and integrate GO with Angular using the back end for front end, BFF, pattern.

I decided to write the software in Kent Beck's [Test-Driven Development By Example](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2003-04/W/3311/sectionM/case_studies/money/KentBeck_TDD_byexample.pdf) in GO, enabling me to learn [Golang test framework](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) while translating a classical testing text to GO.

I'll show the examples’ output using the [Angular application framework](https://angular.io/) connected to a [simple Golang web server](https://github.com/enricofoltran/simple-go-server) server acting as our Back End for a Front End, BFF.

To make things a bit more interesting, I'll also refactor the e2e tests to use [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/) instead of Jasmine.

This repository captures the software I'm writing in this learning journey.

# The repository
I will use a simple Angular structure to integrate the Angular application and the BFF.
````
TestDrivenDevelopmentWithGolang
src
  app - Client source code
  server - BFF source ```
````
# The Angular client application
It will evolve with the complexity of the examples.  There will be a route per example so that we can preserve them in their original state. It will render the tables, but it will not be responsible for any calculations.

# The back end for front end, BFF
It will consist of a simple package with the web server, the examples, and the tests. It will serve a route per example, with each example living in its own file and having its own tests;

# Implementation details
## package.json
## Angular Server proxy
The BFF server listens to a port (5000) different than the Angular application (4200). Below are the changes required to make this work (they are not well documented in Angular)
### Created the proxy.conf.json file
````
{
    "/tdd": {
        "target": "http://localhost:5000",
        "secure": false
    }
}
````
### Configure it to be used when loading applications (angular.json)
````

            "browserTarget": "TestDrivenDevelopmentWithGolang:build",
